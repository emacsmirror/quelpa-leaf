# quelpa-leaf

[![CI](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-leaf/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-leaf/actions/workflows/test.yml)

If you are using [leaf](https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el) (which can help to simplify your .emacs) you can use the [quelpa](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa) handler provided by `quelpa-leaf`.

## üíæ Installation

**Requirements**: Emacs 25.1

Assuming you have bootstrapped `quelpa`, install `quelpa-leaf` (which installs
`leaf` as a dependency) and require the library:

```el
(quelpa
 '(quelpa-leaf
   :fetcher git
   :url "https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-leaf.git"))
(require 'quelpa-leaf)
(quelpa-leaf-init)
```

## üîß Usage

After that it is possible to call `leaf` with the `:quelpa` keyword:

```cl
;; installs abc-mode with quelpa
(leaf abc-mode :quelpa)

;; does the same (`t' is optional)
(leaf abc-mode :quelpa t)

;; again... (if the package would have another name)
(leaf abc-mode :quelpa abc-mode)

;; passes upgrade parameter to quelpa
(leaf abc-mode :quelpa (:upgrade t))

;; uses the given recipe
(leaf abc-mode
  :quelpa (abc-mode :fetcher github :repo "mkjunker/abc-mode"))

;; recipe with plist arguments
(leaf abc-mode
  :quelpa ((abc-mode :fetcher github :repo "mkjunker/abc-mode") :upgrade t))
```

The `quelpa` handler is compatible with [MELPA's recipe format](https://github.com/melpa/melpa#recipe-format). You may want to check the optional properties not mentioned above.
